##Data Structures
1. Why are data structures useful in programming?
Data structures provide a building block for us to manipulate.  It allows us to store information, organize data, nest code, and so mcuh more.

##Arrays
2. Define "array" and describe the characteristics of an array.
An array is a list of information stored in [].  An array can be called using it's index and can be nested (multidemensional array).

3. Give two original examples of data sets that an array might be well-suited for.
family_names = ["Bob", "Cinday", "Yogi", "Britney", "Kevin"]
food_choices = ["hotdog", "sandwich", "pizza", "burrito", "taco"]

##Hashes
4. Define "hash" and describe the characteristics of a hash.
A hash is a set of key-value pairs.  A value can be called by using the hash_name[key_value].

5. Give two original examples of data sets that a hash might be well-suited for.
food_prices = {
  "pizza" => 2,
  "taco" => 2
  "burrito" => 4
  "hotdog" => 3
}

grades = {
  "Kelly" => 98,
  "Bob" => 75,
  "Britney" => 88,
  "Tom" => 93
}

##Iteration
6. Why is iteration useful?
Iteration is useful because it allows us to loop through a set of code the required amount of times until a condition is met.  This makes the possibilities in coding infinite and allows us to accomplish very specific tasks.

7. Give an example of a real-life task that would require iteration if you wrote an algorithm for it.
A real life example would be buying enough oranges until we have on for each family member.
Ex:
    family_members = ["Bob", "Cindy", "Kevin"]
    orange_count = 0
    while orange_count < family_members.length
    puts "Buy orange"
    orange_count += 1
    end

##Blocks
8. What is a block?
A block is a section of code using a do and end statement or burly braces {}.

9. What is a block parameter, and where does its value come from?
A block's parameter is set but the programmer.
Ex:
    [1, 2, 3].each {|x| puts x * 3}
