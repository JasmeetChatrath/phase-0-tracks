##Variables
1.  Variables are use to declare variables.  A programmer uses this because it allows them to manipulate code and create programs.
2.  If we entered:
    first_name = "Abraham"
    last_name = "Lincoln"
    full_name = first_name + last_name
ruby would run it from the top down, on line at a time.  The final result would be
    "AbrahamLincoln"
although it wouldn't print to the console unless we added a command to do so.
##Date Types
3.
*string: A string is anything we put between "".  Ex: dog = "Yogi"
*integer:  An integer is a number not in ""s.  If we have string we'd like to use as an integer we use .to_i.  Ex: 4
*Float:  A float is an integer with a decimal point.  Ex: 4.3
*nil:  Nil is another way of saying nothing in ruby.
*boolean:  A boolean can be true or false.  Ex: 3 > 4 would be false.
##Algorithms
4.  An algorithm tell our interpreter step by step what we'd like it to do so it executes our command.
5.  Common algorithms in computer science are loops and comparators.
##Methods
6.  A method is a reusable section of code. A programmer would use this to save time.
8. Global scope means we can access said portion of code from anywhere in the code.  Method scope means we can access it only within that method.
##Control Flow
9.  Control flow is the order in which individual cide us called.  This give the programmer more control and options.
10.
*loop:  A loop repeats a section of code until a condition is met
*if: this say if so and so condition is present proceed to the following step
*else: else is the alternative option in our if statement
*elsif: this is used when we want to add additonal options besides if and else
*while: this says while this condition takes place do the following
*until: this tells out while loop when to break
